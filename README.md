Hey Everyone,

Thanks for taking the time to check out my completed FrontEndMentor project! I've decided to take on the challenge of completing as many FEM projects as possible, starting from easiest then working my way up to harder ones. While this challenge "looked" easy, I quickly found out that looks can be deceiving. I had a couple of notable issues come up, which can happen when working with CSS from time to time. Initially, the trickiest thing for me was getting the shape of the top background graphic to be precise. These properties turned out to be lifesavers that did the trick!
border-top-left-radius: inherit;
border-top-right-radius: inherit;

In addition to the background graphic, the second item that I had the biggest issue with (and honestly gave up on haha) was getting the bottom alignment precise on the "Cancel Order" URL on the mobile view. Design challenges are a lot of fun IMO, but I've learned that they don't always quite work out as planned for various reasons lol. This took me approx 2.5-3 hours between two days to get this close. When I work on these challenges, I pay very close attention to the Figma guides to try and get the spacing/margins/sizes down as accurately as possible.

I enjoy building sites/content from Figma files in particular, since I lack the creativity to come up with an original design from scratch and turn it into a finished product. Maybe one day I'll get there! Thanks for reading :D!
